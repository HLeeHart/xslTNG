<para>These stylesheets are the third
iteration of stylesheets for DocBook that I’ve written. I started working on the
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets">XSLT 1.0
Stylesheets for DocBook</link> in the 90’s, before XSLT 1.0 was
even a W3C Recommendation. I started working on the
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-stylesheets">XSLT 2.0
Stylesheets for DocBook</link> just around the time when XSLT 2.0 became
a W3C Recommendation. I wrote most of
<citetitle>DocBook xslTNG</citetitle> just a month or so before the third anniversary
of the XSLT 3.0 Recommendation.</para>

<para>Why did it take so long?</para>
