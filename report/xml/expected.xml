 <title>Example of expected results</title>
</info>
<para>The expected results include only the <tag>body</tag> of each 
HTML file. The <tag>head</tag> isn’t included because it varies too
much from document to document.</para>
<para>The <tag>head</tag> from <emphasis>this</emphasis> document is used
when publishing the expected output in the website. (If the documents
are published without a <tag>head</tag>, it isn’t very useful to look
at them with a browser.)</para>
